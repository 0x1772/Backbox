# Backbox
## Your Pentest Box
### Backbox is a automated peneteration testing tool for you jobs. You can find some scripts with automation for example:

```Vulnerability Scanner by 0x1772```
```PyPhisher by KasRoudra```
```Ip Tracer by htr-tech```
```Ip Changer tool by /neo```

- Just type function you want and scripts do it automatically and see the real ✨Magic ✨

## Features

- You can scan for vulnerabilities with Vulnerability Scanner and it reports everything for you.
- If you want ipchanger changes your ip automatically with your choice before scan or phishing.
- Your privacy is important for me so i will update ipchanger with more function.
- You can track ip adresses with IpTracer and it will help you with ngrok installation and with local ports.
- If you want to join me for developing this tool you can reach me from [Telegram][https://t.me/FakeSmileux]
